We highly recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) for easy Node.js version management.

Access to the Ronnie's Ent backend API.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO_URL> movie-platform-frontend

Replace <YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO_URL> with the actual Git clone URL of your frontend repository.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd movie-platform-frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configuration

VITE_NODE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

VITE_NODE_BACKEND_URL: This should be the local URL of your running Node.js backend API.

VITE_FRONTEND_URL: This specifies the local URL where your frontend application will be served.

Running the Application
To start the development server and view the application:

npm run dev

The application will typically be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8080 (or http://localhost:5173, depending on your Vite configuration).

Ronnie's Ent is architected for seamless deployment to modern cloud hosting services.

Frontend Deployment: We recommend deploying the frontend application on platforms such as Vercel or Netlify.

Backend & Database Deployment: The accompanying Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database are ideally suited for robust platforms like Render.
