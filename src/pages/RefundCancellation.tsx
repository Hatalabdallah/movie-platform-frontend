            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Ronnie's Entertainment operates on a strict <strong>no-refund policy</strong> for all subscription purchases, with specific exceptions as outlined below.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>General Policy (No Refunds for Used Service):</strong>
                <p>
                  Due to the immediate access granted to our extensive movie library for <strong>download</strong> upon subscription activation, we generally do not offer refunds for any portion of a Subscription Period that has already commenced or been utilized. This includes, but is not limited to, cases where:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                  <li>You have accessed or downloaded any movies during the Subscription Period.</li>
                  <li>You have simply changed your mind after subscribing.</li>
                  <li>You no longer wish to use the Service before your current Subscription Period ends.</li>
                  <li>Your account is terminated due to a violation of our Terms of Service.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exceptions (Eligible for Full Refund):</strong>
                <ul className="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Technical Issues Preventing Access:</strong> If you experience persistent technical issues directly attributable to Ronnie's Entertainment that prevent you from accessing the core Service for <strong>downloading movies</strong> for a significant portion (e.g., more than 72 consecutive hours) of your Subscription Period, and our support team is unable to resolve these issues within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a full refund. Such cases will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and require documented evidence of the issue and communication with our support team.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Billing Errors:</strong> In the event of an accidental duplicate charge or an incorrect billing amount directly caused by Ronnie's Entertainment's system, a full refund for the erroneous charge will be issued.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Partial Refunds:</strong>
                <p>
                  Ronnie's Entertainment does not offer partial refunds for any unused portion of a Subscription Period. Once a Subscription Period begins, it is considered fully utilized for billing purposes.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Processing Refunds (If Applicable):</strong>
                <p>
                  Approved refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 7-10 business days of approval. The actual time for the refund to appear in your account may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.
                </p>
